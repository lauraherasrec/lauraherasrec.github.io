Welcome to my website!

📚 I am a fifth year PhD candidate in Economics at American University. I have a multidisciplinary educational background in economics, development studies, and psychology. I hold a MA in Economic Policy and Analysis from Université Paris 13 Nord and Université Paris VII Diderot, a MA in Development Studies from the University of the Basque Country, a BA in Economics from Autonomous University of Madrid, and a BA in Psychology from the National University of Distance Education. You can find my CV [here](https://lauraherasrec.github.io/files/AcademicCV_HerasRecuero.pdf). 

📝 My research interests are development macroeconomics, applied macroeconomics, economic history, productive development, inequality and Latin American economies.

👩‍💻 I have professional experience in economic research and analysis in international organizations (IDB, OECD), central banking (Banco de España), and higher education institutions (AU, EHESS, UAM).
