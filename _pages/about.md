Welcome to my website!

I am a fifth year PhD candidate in Economics at American University, writing my dissertation on economic development in Latin America. My research interests are in development macroeconomics, applied macroeconomics, productive development, trade, inequality and Latin American economies.

I have professional experience in economic research and analysis in international organizations (IDB, OECD), central banking (Banco de España), and higher education institutions (AU, EHESS, UAM).

I am a person with multiple interests and a multidisciplinary educational background in economics, development studies, and psychology. I hold a MA in Economic Policy and Analysis from Université Paris 13 Nord and Université Paris VII Diderot, a MA in Development Studies from the University of the Basque Country, a BA in Economics from Autonomous University of Madrid, and a BA in Psychology from the National University of Distance Education.
